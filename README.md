<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Simple BMI Calculator][app-screenshot1]](#)

There are many great BMI calculators available on the appstore, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this super simple one. I want to create a BMI calculator so quick and easy to use that you never get lazy about checking.

Here's why:
* Your fitness apps shouldn't get in the way of your active lifestyle
* You shouldn't be doing simple tasks using bloated slow apps

Of course, I also wanted to implement the sleek design I found on dribbble by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator)

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
